# draggables
Experimenting with draggable elements in html/css/js

the base level index.html is the working one, using "draggableElement.js" but the code is spaghetti. In the components folder there is another, testPage.html that utilizes the ongoing (non working) "draggables.js" conversion to a class-based and hopefully simpler implementation conversion from the base-level one.

# draggables
Experimenting with draggable elements in html/css/js

the base level index.html is the working one, no longer using "draggableElement.js"; the code is spaghetti. In the components folder there is another, draggables.js that is now utilizing the ongoing "draggables.js" conversion to a functional programming based and hopefully simpler implementation conversion from the original one.
